  Lately, I've been scraping xvideos for a few things, more specifically looking for ways to identify videos containing children or women who were trafficked, and thought it would be interesting to do a comprehensive study of that porn site. I originally started scraping for comments, because there are a lot of people who comment and publicly admit to abusing children, mostly their own kids, and I thought that would be interesting information to collect and submit to the police. However, since then I realized there's a lot more data to search for and a lot more research to explore. I was thinking of a few sections:
Potential signs of trafficking - there are a lot of videos and channels of people going to Asia for sex tourism, and very often those girls are trafficked and underage. To search for that, I was thinking to look at tags such as "Asian", "Young" , "Chinese", etc, as well as the video uploader information. The video uploader usually has a bio, and if it's a channel, then it likely has a link to another website on the clearnet. Also, I'd look at the channel verification status, because usually the channels that upload suspicious content are not verified. 
Signs of csam- this one is a little harder to find for a few reasons: 
Videos with potential csam might be harder to locate because they may not have any comments, tags, or video title – I’ve seen a video with a string of numbers as a title but the video looked like it was of an underage girl. However, knowing that a video likely containing csam is missing certain criteria could also be a way to search for them?
Roleplay is very common, so it would be hard to differentiate between someone roleplaying as a teen (especially if they look young for their age) and finding an actual teen
Some teens look older for their age, so it would be hard to tell they're a teen
There are a few tags I think would be useful to start searching csam vids- tags such as "young", 'Teen", "petite", "Tiny", "innocent", "cam" -I've noticed a lot of csam vids contain only the tag cam, and I think that's because the girl in the video was probably forced or coerced to send a video of themselves not knowing that the person receiving that video was an adult and also would upload/ share that video without their consent. What makes those vids more suspicious is that the girl sometimes hides her face or is still clothed, whereas someone who was an adult sex worker would probably not be so camera shy.  Additionally, looking at the verification status of the video uploader is also worth noting, as well as if the video has tagged any actresses. I've noticed that some actresses are tagged in a video, but they don't upload their own, so it seems more like an account was created on behalf of the actress, maybe to make it seem more legitimate. 
Correlation between teen vids and people offending - I've noticed teen vids are  very common, and there is research to suggest people who have a porn addiction search for videos with children because they want harder material to get them off. Often, the line between watching someone play a teen online and recognizing that that's fake becomes blurred and people tend to abuse actual teens, or collect more csam. 
Violence against women- apart from women being trafficked, there are a lot of videos under the tag "abuse" and I've noticed many of those are of women passed out with things shoved up their privates. There's also videos of women being secretly recorded without their consent. So I'd like to explore this as a broader topic and maybe it's influence on society.
I know there's a lot of research about girls in csam, but I thought it would be interesting to assess boys in csam as well, and if there are any indicators in the videos uploaded if boys are abused or trafficked. Child abuse doesn't discriminate on gender, and I think it's worth helping boys too, even if it's harder to identify their age in videos.

I was thinking of performing a network analysis to search for more videos - so I'd look for videos under teens, see what other videos that uploader uploaded, see the videos that uploader has as their favorites, do the same for the commentors, and then assess all of that, based on certain indicators, if those videos contain csam and then also pass the information of the people responsible for viewing/uploading csam to the police. 

One goal I have that I'd like to start after scraping all of the data, is some form of facial recognition to help detect kids. But I know that's a lot harder, which is why I will hold up on that for now.
